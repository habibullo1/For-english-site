    <h1>Hisar mountain range</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Hisar range is a mountain range located in Central Asia.
        It is located in the western part of the Pamir-Olay Mountains (in the Republics of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan),
        in the watershed of the Zarafshan, Kashkadarya and Amudarya basins.
        The Hisar ridge and its major branches Boysuntog and Kohitangtog are mainly composed of granite, limestone and
        shale.
        The Hisar mountain range was formed during the folding of the Hercynian mountain. The southwestern branches of
        the mountain range correspond tectonically to the southwestern part of the Hisar megaanticline. They are covered
        with sedimentary rocks of the Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene periods.
        The highest peak on the territory of Uzbekistan is Hazrat Sultan peak (4643 meters) in the Hisar mountain range.
        Along with this, the Boisuntog and Chakchar mountain peaks are also located in the area.
        Jinni Daryo (57 km) starts from springs between Okota and Shertog mountains of the Hisar mountain range.
        Aksuv (115 km) is formed by the confluence of tributaries formed by the Botirboy and Seversev mountain glaciers
        of the Hisar ridge.
        The terrain is complex, rocky, and many places are fragmented. It has formed deep cuts with dense and
        gorge-shaped rivers scattered on leveled surfaces in the watershed and on its slopes.
        In the spring, ephemera and ephemeroids, wheat and wormwood grow. There are bitter almonds, currants, hawthorns
        and others from the bushes. Cattle are grazed on pastures.
        Wild mammals include mountain goats, mountain sheep, bears, foxes, martens, badgers, snow leopards, lynxes, red
        grouse, birds, mountain turkeys, partridges, and other animals.

    <p>The Hisar-Olai Mountains are a mountain system in Central Asia. It is bordered by the Fergana basin in the north,
        the Pamir mountains and the Afghan-Tajikistan basin in the south, the Qizilkum desert in the west, and the
        southeastern part of the Fergana and Qaqshal ridges in the east. It includes the Olay Range, the Turkestan
        Range, the Nurota Mountains, the Zarafshan Range and the Hisar Range. They are separated from each other by
        small tectonic depressions and river valleys and consist of several dams. The eastern part of H.-Hisor-Olai is
        located in the territory of Kyrgyzstan, the middle part is in Tajikistan, and the western part is in the
        territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan. All the ridges are more than 900 km long. H.-Hisar-Olay begins in the
        east with the Olay ridge. The ridge is bounded by the Fergana basin from the north, the Olay basin from the
        south, and is the watershed of the Syrdarya and Amudarya rivers. Most of the tributaries of these rivers
        (Vakhsh, Kofarnihan, Surkhandarya, Akbura, Isfayram, Khojabaqirgan, Shahimardan, etc.) start from the Olay
        ridge.

        H.-Hisor-Olai was formed during the Hersian folding and rose to its current height under the influence of new
        tectonic movements. The ridges are mainly composed of Paleozoic sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks
        (shale, sandstone, conglomerate, limestone, dolomite, granite, granodiorite, etc.). The botikdar, river valleys
        separating the ridges and the southwestern branch of Hisar are made of Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene, Neogene
        and Quaternary sedimentary rocks.

        Tectonically, H.-Hisor-Olay forms a single large anticlinorium, while separate ridges correspond to the
        anticlinorium.</p>
